= Pygments formatter for xsl-fo output =

This is a formatter for [http://pygments.org pygments] that produces
output marked up with <fo:inline> tags with the appropriate
colour and other presentational attributes set according to
the pygments style in use.

To be useful this must be embeded in a complete xsl-fo document.
It was developed for use with [http://asciidoc.org asciidoc]
to produce PDF's using [http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop fop] with
minimal configuration or extra dependencies.

It is possible that it could be used in more general docbook to pdf
tool chains.

== Installation ==
It is not currently available in pypi, so it must be installed from
the source distibution.
Use any of the normal installation methods from the top
directory of the distribution to install.

<pre code="console">
$ python setup.py install   # Usual setup.py installation method

$ pip install .             # Using pip
</pre>

This will install pygments if it is not already installed.
You can check that it is working by listing the formatters
and checking for the presence of one containing ''xslfo''.

<pre code=console>
$ pygmentize -L formatters
Formatters:
~~~~~~~~~~~
[... ommitted output ...]
* xslfo, xsl-fo:
    Format tokens as XSL-FO ``<fo:inline>`` tags.
</pre>

== Usage ==

As this just adds a new formatter type to pygments, you just use
'xslfo' where ever you might, for example, specify 'html' as a
formatter name.

<pre code=console>
$ pygmentize -f xslso -l python setup.py
</pre>

You should see lots of <fo:inline> tags

To use with asciidoc, which is the initial purpose of this extension
look at the example directory which contains a simple but complete
example.

== Example result ==
